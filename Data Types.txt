Exercises:
Vectors
1. Create numeric vectors:
o of values 1, 5, 6 and 7
o of sequential values 1 to 10 and store it in variable called "tst"
o of 10 values, each one 42
o same as above, then multiply each value by 10
o of 100 random integers between 1 and 50 and store it in variable called "tst2"
2. Create a character vector of three values: "Centre", "Longitudinal", "Studies"
3. Create a vector of 10 values, alternating 1 and 2, then convert it to a factor with 1 for yes and 2 for no.
4. Create a vector of the first day of each year since 1995
5. Subset tst to include only the first three values
6. Subset tst2 to only include values less than 20 and more than 10
Data frames

a. votes.csv
b. votes.sav
c. votes.Rda
2. Combine the first two above data frames into one
3. Merge in the third data set joining by the 'Party' variable and store in variable votesDF
